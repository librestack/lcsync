NEXT ACTIONS:

Now sync using multiple threads and bredth-first search.
refactor net_recv_data()
net_job_diff_tree()

missing tests:
- net_recv_subtree()
- net_send_block()
- net_job_diff_tree()

* ensure for blocksz > 1024 that bit map is set correctly for last block. ie. it
may not be a full set of packets.

* write test to sync, scribble and confirm exact countbits() to make sure we're
not re-copying data.

* test msync

chunksz -> blocksz to fix inconsistency
