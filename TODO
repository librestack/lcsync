NEXT ACTIONS:

Document the function calls and structures.

Ensure trees are sent / received and validated properly.

Update cli to show differences without syncing -n / --dry-run

Now sync using multiple threads and bredth-first search.
refactor net_recv_data()
net_job_diff_tree()

missing tests:
- net_recv_subtree()
- net_send_block()
- net_job_diff_tree()

ensure for blocksz > 1024 that bit map is set correctly for last block. ie. it
may not be a full set of packets.

* write test to sync, scribble and confirm exact countbits() to make sure we're
not re-copying data.

* test msync
