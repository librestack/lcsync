NEXT ACTIONS:

figure out the differences between the various net_* functions, particularly
net_send() and net_send_data() - are they all needed?

Document the function calls and structures.

Ensure trees are sent / received and validated properly.

Update cli to show differences without syncing -n / --dry-run

Now sync subtrees, starting with single-threaded root=0

Now sync using multiple threads and bredth-first search.

missing tests:
- net_recv_subtree()
- net_send_block()
- net_job_diff_tree()

----------------------------------------------------------------------
