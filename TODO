NEXT ACTION: sync data based on tree

* set up new test for net_send() / net_recv()
- build source data
- generate tree
- send tree (what header information do we send?)
- send blocks

- recv source tree
- verify tree
- build channel maps
- join required channels
- receive blocks
- verify blocks / check hashes
- part channels / cleanup

* concatenate block bitmaps into channel bitmaps
* send / receive + verify tree
* do the actual sending / receiving of blocks
* check hashes
* multicast sync
* MTU path discovery for block size
* MLD triggering - don't send when noone listening
* flow control
* FEC
* resizing of merkle tree for changing data
* file sharding
* man page - output from help
* handle -- in options
* handle - to input from stdin
* improve / extend librecast API with supporting functions
