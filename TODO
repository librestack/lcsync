NEXT ACTIONS:

Disable failing tests.  Clean slate.  Get back to green.

Update bitmap code to cater for block sizes other than 1024.  This is
fundamental, so do this first.  Adding it later will break many things.

Test with full block changes (not just first byte diffs).

Ensure trees are sent / received and validated properly.

Update cli to show differences without syncing -n / --dry-run

Now sync subtrees, starting with single-threaded root=0

Now sync using multiple threads and bredth-first search.

Ensure all tests pass in check mode (valgrind).  Clean code please.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* send file permissions
* --blocksz
* --delay
* -n / --dry-run

* set up new test for net_send() / net_recv()
- build source data
- generate tree
- send tree (what header information do we send?)
- send blocks

- recv source tree
- verify tree
- build channel maps
- join required channels
- receive blocks
- verify blocks / check hashes
- part channels / cleanup

* concatenate block bitmaps into channel bitmaps
* send / receive + verify tree
* do the actual sending / receiving of blocks
* check hashes
* multicast sync
* MTU path discovery for block size
* MLD triggering - don't send when noone listening
* flow control
* FEC
* resizing of merkle tree for changing data
* file sharding
* man page - output from help
* handle -- in options
* handle - to input from stdin
* improve / extend librecast API with supporting functions
* (Linux) eBPF
